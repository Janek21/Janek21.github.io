   <h1>Welcome to Janek's webbed site</h1>
   <p>In this page I'll talk about bioinformatics (probably)
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics">Bioinformatics<a> are an interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, and information technology to analyze and interpret biological data. It involves the application of computational techniques to understand biological systems, such as DNA sequencing, protein structure, and gene expression.
   <p>This website is just a test to challenge myself learning new languages and developing new ideas
